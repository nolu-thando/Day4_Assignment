Question 1:
Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
- Timely delivery is cruial in Software project management because it helps in meeting the clients expactations, it saves costs, improves communication between the business
  and the customer. It is also crucial because it may alao affect the customer's satisfavtion. Project managers can ensure that deadlines are met by knowing the strengthens
  and weaknesses of their team. How well their team communicates and how well they work under pressure. They should also create a detailed plan with realistic deadlines. Prioritize
  hard or tasks that seem to be challanging or time consuming.

Question 2:
How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
- Cost control contributes to the success of a software project in a huge way because it helps with keeping the project within budget. It also helps in optimizing the resources
needed for the project. It also reduces a project's financial risk.

Question 3:
Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile: allows you to work flexibly.
##Advantage:
- Allows you to adapt to change quickly.
- There's frequent customer feedback
- It improves team collaborations.
##Disadvantages:
- Lack of detailed documentation.
- Its difficutlt to work with large projects.
- Relies a lot on customer engagement for a team to make decisions throughout the project.
  
Waterfall: allows you to work in a linear/straight forward way. The first task must be completed before you can move to the next.
##Advantages:
- It has detailed documentation.
- It has a clear structure/ it gives us a clear structure of the project.
##Disadvantages:
- It is inflexible(cannot adapt to rapid change).
- It can be costly at times.

Question 4: 
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial in projects than Waterfall because it can be used in:
- Software Development projects, projects that are more cloud-based applications, mobile applications and or web development projects.
- Projects with rapid change.
- Projects with limited resources, it enables the team to focus and prioritize critical tasks.
Waterfall is more beneficial than Agile because:
- It allows you to work on projects that are less complex and risky.
- It also allows you to work on projects that have long development cycles.
- It allows you to work with projects that have limited need for creativity.

Question 5:
What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
- Test-Driven Development
- Code Reviews
- Automated Testing
- Manual Testing
- User Acceptance Testing
- Continuous Monitoring and Feedback
It is important for a couple of reasons like reliability and stability(ensuring that the project functions as requested or planned). It also helps in user experience,
increasing user satisfaction, loyalty and engagement.

Question 6:
How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
It contributes to a successful project planning in a good way because it gives us clear objectives, focused  efforts, realistic expectations, improved communication and
better risk management strategies.
- Work Breadown Structure is a breakdown of the project into smaller and manageable tasks. One can also define it as a visual representation of a project scope, breaking down
  the work into more detailed components.
- It is useful because it helps with identifying all the tasks required to complete the project(project planning). It organizes tasks into logical structures and makes it easy to
  manage and track a projects/teams progress.
Question 7:
What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
- Improved Project Planning
- Team Collaboration
- Better Resource allocation
- Increases Productivity
- Reduces Risks
- Improves Communication
The Gantt charts can assist in the process by creating visual representation, task dependencies, timeline management, resource allocation and progress tracking.

Question 8:
What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address the number we have of female developers vs the male developers. These problems are significant because this will show females that
technology r coding isn't a "males" only thing. Females too can make the best out of it.

Question 9:
How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
- We have to set the scope of work before stating thr requirements.  This will help us have a clearer set of requirements which are related to the scope and save time.

Question 10:
How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
- My software solution is designed to empower females to make tech-driven decisions, drive their tech growth and keep their head in the game. It is a platform that provides
  insights, complex processes and allows collaborations within female developers.

Question 11:
What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
- Automated workflow
- Customizable dashboard
- Collaboration tools
- Drag and drop interface
- Flexibility, Scalabilty and Reliability


Question 13:
How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
- Understanding market trends informs you emerging technologies, new business models, how you can shift user behaviors and more.
